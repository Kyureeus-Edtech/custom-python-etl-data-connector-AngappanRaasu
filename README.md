# Software Architecture Assignment: Custom Python ETL Data Connector (IP Geolocation Connector)

Welcome to the official repository for submitting your Software Architecture assignment on building custom ETL data connectors in Python. This project demonstrates a Python connector for fetching geolocation data from the [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/) API and storing it in MongoDB.  

This assignment is part of the Kyureeus EdTech program for SSN CSE students.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Overview

**Goal:**  
Develop a Python ETL pipeline that connects with the IP Geolocation API, extracts data, transforms it for MongoDB compatibility, and loads it into a MongoDB collection. Follow secure coding and project structure practices.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights

- Connects to [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/) to fetch geolocation data for IP addresses or domain names.  
- Supports JSON response format for easy MongoDB storage.  
- Stores API responses in MongoDB with timestamps.  
- Secure credentials management using `.env` (for MongoDB URI, database, and collection).  
- Easily extendable to handle multiple queries or separate collections per IP/domain.
